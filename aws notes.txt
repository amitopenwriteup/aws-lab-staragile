What is cloud computing?

-->What is datacenter?

Hardware resources (Compute,storage,networking)

They will host their software/application


--->2000-->

amazon and VMware

VMware-->Creating datacenter in premises and provide access over the browser

aws--> Datacenter across the world to the other organization


DC-->across world, using the browser

You will be using the service--Hardware 


----------------------
Cloud computing is an enablement of services which we want to use to run our application or software.

IAAS : Infra as a service
PAAS : Platform as a service
SAAS: software as a service

computing: cpu + memory

storage

Networking

---------------

AWS-->Loan that hardware resources in form services


Service-->configuration and design of the aws services


ABC-->has its own dc-->which is in India (Mumbai location)

500 servers

Lot of approvals,


Cloud computing


DC-->AWS location



Pay as you go model--


DB/Containerizaiton

mysql-->enterprise -->Replication (Service model)



aws  services


MySQL service (Configuration)
------------------------------------

Regions--> AWS dc location

Location-->you can have two or more than two DC (zones)


Client-->Location constraint (Bank)--> RBI guideline (finance, defence, phrama)


Region --> Mumbai-->two zones available

Nearest location from where your cusumers will be accessing

-----


Lease line provided to access the cloud (AWS direct connect)

-------------

AWS cloud--->

xyz --->persone1

abc-->person2

aws region-->zone




--->DC--mumbai--->		 (VPC), xyz (VPC)



10.0.0.0/24 (VPC) :256

10.0.0.0/24

10.0.0.0/28





11111111.1111111.1111111.11100000






Route table

-->internet gateway



-
------------------------

AWS cloud-->Public cloud provider (DC)

VPC-->Logical Datacenter (Pragmatically they are controlling the stuff)


DC-->across globe-->Regions


Availbility zones: HA(Redundancy)


--------------

Private subnet vs public subnet


Prod-->webserver (public subnet) two network adapter

database

database-->(private subnet


AWS direct connect (Lease line)

VM-->webserver-->public subnet (Jump server)
	-->private subnet

DB-->private subnet

-------------------

My EC2 instance has public ip, still i am not able to access it over the internet? why?

22?

IGW--?



EC2? IAAS layer

Create vm-->DB(installing yourself)-->Take care db, issue occur db,upgrade

I need DB--> Mysql-->Version-->connection string: No installation , no mantainance

IAAS-->Consumer ownership/control, SME

VM-->application /upgrade, you will be less amount aws

PAAS

SAAS-->don't need aws sme,
----------------------------------
VM?

Ec2-->
----

Purchased hardware--->Virtualization  os (Xenserver)-->ec2 instance


Ec2-->Elastic cloud computing-->


VM-->Simpulation of virtual h/w--> cpu,memory,h/d,network created using virualization

22

-----------

SSH based authentication

basic auth--> username/password (Highly discouraged)

ssh authentication

Keypair-->public key/private key



ssh-->encrypted packet to the remote address..public key decrypt

RSA/ED25519


ppk..


putty/mobaxterme-->to connect Linux os remotely



-------------

MYSQL DB


--------------





VM-->webserver-->Configuration-->Own blueprint for the new instance
 Readonly blueprint of yourvm

Vm-->

SET OF FILES	-->hd/memory (swap file)

---------------




--->traffic load balance--->target (VM) running out of resource + 1vm+1vm

-----------------------
Horizontal scaling (1--->10)



irctc/hotstar/upi

10am

irctc.com (Webserver)-->homepage

before 10am

after 12pm

100time


irctc.com--->LB--->webserver(spike happens in webserver) > 80% + webserver +web+web



initiate--LB--->VM(ip)



sourceip destinationip-->NAT


egress
